# 4TechBot
this was like my first ever bot made in python, please keep that in mind before you say "DUUUUU YOU SHOULDVE USED COGS INSTEAD OF PUTTING EVERYTHING IN ONE FILE"\
i don't even use discord.py anymore btw

# please read
yes i know the token is leaked, but the bot app doesn't exist anymore so why bother

# special thanks

r.i.p my old laptop, and along with that, r.i.p SpookyBot and SpookyMusic, r.i.p botmon, r.i.p sniper monkey, r.i.p snapbot/brohbot, and r.i.p all my other old bots\
you all will be missed\
thanks and happy exploring my 2020 self's code\
